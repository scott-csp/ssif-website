## The Opportunity

Somalia receives over **2,000 kWh/m² of solar energy annually** — among the highest solar resources in the world — yet electricity remains scarce and expensive, with current costs ranging from **$0.50 to $1.00 per kWh**. This creates a compelling case for solar investment.

SSIF provides **Shariah-compliant financing** to Somali businesses, institutions, and households for the purchase of solar equipment and installation. As clients repay their financing, revenue flows back to the fund and is distributed to investors.

Projects are implemented exclusively by **ClearSky Power**, an established solar EPC firm with a proven track record of delivery across Somalia.
